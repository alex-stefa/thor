If a server receives a request where the sum of the data frame payload lengths does not equal the size of the Content-Length header, the server MUST return a 400 (Bad Request) error.

POST-specific changes:

Although POSTs are inherently chunked, POST requests SHOULD also be accompanied by a Content-Length header. There are two reasons for this: First, it assists with upload progress meters for an improved user experience. But second, we know from early versions of SPDY that failure to send a content length header is incompatible with many existing HTTP server implementations. Existing user-agents do not omit the Content-Length header, and server implementations have come to depend upon this.

If the server sends a HEADERS frame containing duplicate headers with a previous HEADERS frame for the same stream, the client must issue a stream error (Section 2.4.2) with error code PROTOCOL ERROR."

If the server sends a HEADERS frame after sending a data frame for the same stream, the client MAY ignore the HEADERS frame. Ignoring the HEADERS frame after a data frame prevents handling of HTTP's trailing headers."

The user-agent is free to prioritize requests as it sees fit. If the user-agent cannot make progress without receiving a resource, it should attempt to raise the priority of that resource. Resources such as images, SHOULD generally use the lowest priority.
